This is an experiemental lotto app that will have the ability to forcast winning numbers. On the backend, I have been feeding the dataset with past winning numbers until the model is able to learn how to forcast winning numbers right.

This will start from getting one number right then, getting 2 numbers right until model is able to forcast entire winning lotto numbers.
